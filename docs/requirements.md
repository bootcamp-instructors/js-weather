# Weather Application

A webpage that prompts users to enter a zipcode, then
displays current weather information for that location
or a friendly error message if the zipcode is not found.

## Tech

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

## Wireframe

See wireframe-js-weather.png.

## MVP (minimal viable product)

The app should display a title, input box for zipcode, and
submit button.

That's all that should display by default.

When the submit button is clicked, the application should 
fetch weather data from api.openweathermap.org. 

If the request is successful, display:
1. City name 
2. Current conditions,
3. Current temperature in Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celius, and
4. an image, selected by the current temperature.

If the request is not successful, display an error message.

## Enhancements

1. Improve error messaging to be more specific.
